# Audit Submissions

> Each Submission corresponds to one audit entity. Audit is auto-generated when the submission is created by copying submission's annotation.

![Go to Audit tab.](img/step6-1.png)

![Audit submission with `UNSET` result status.](img/step6-2.png)

![Submit back to MTurk Management if there are modifications, if not just close Vidat.](img/step6-3.png)

![Find the newly updated audit by search/filter on the top, then select the audit and use button `Mark as xxx` to change the Result status accordingly.](img/step6-4.png)

# Progress Status

> `AUDIT PASS FAIL UNSET COUNT `number of pass/file/unset audit results
>
> `SUBMISSION COUNT` number of submissions
>
> `PROGRESS` number of non-UNSET audit results / number of submissions

![Go to batch/task tab, the progress status can be monitored by `AUDIT PASS FAIL UNSET COUNT`, `SUBMISSION COUNT` and `PROGRESS`.](img/step7.png)

# Delete a Batch

![The ER model](img/database.svg)

> All the foreignkeys are set to [CASCADED](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete) on delete, therefore, whenever you delete a batch, all the related tasks are also removed, so is the submissions and the audits.

![When deleting a batch, all related objects will show up on the warning page](img/step8.png)

> Thanks for your cooperation, cheers!
